## Problem Statement
Managing a player auction across multiple teams is complex. Each team has a limited budget, a fixed number of slots, and specific role requirements (e.g., batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, wicket-keepers).  
Without a structured system, tracking bids, ensuring budget compliance, and monitoring balance sheets becomes error-prone and time-consuming.
